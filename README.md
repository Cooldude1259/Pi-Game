This is just a simple game to help you remember the first 10 decimal points of Pi. This is just a simple program.
Dont think it to be too complicated. I made it in around 5-10 minutes!

How to run:
- Make sure that you have Python installed (3.11 or later)
- Install by pressing Code -> Downlaod Zip
- Unzip file
- Run the program by double clicking it or another way specific to your device

If there is a different way to do things, please help me out. I am pretty new in coding and especially in GitHub and open-source things. If you can make a contribution, that would be deeply appreciated!
